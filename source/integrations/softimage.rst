Softimage Integration
*********************

The Softimage integration is composed of the Kraken plug-in for Softimage but also the Softimage workgroup and plug-in that adds a menu entry for launching the Kraken UI. The functionality of Kraken is the same as the stand alone other than this integration creates Softimage objects with the current scene.
